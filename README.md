##  Machine-Learning Practice

___
### What youâ€™ll learn


* Understand the life cycle of a machine learning project - typical steps involved and tools that can be used in each step.

* Using machine learning algorithms to solve practical problems using libraries like scikit-learn and tensorflow.

* Fine tuning the algorithms through regularization, feature selection, and better models.

* Develop an understanding of evaluation of machine learning algorithms and decide the next steps based on the analysis.
